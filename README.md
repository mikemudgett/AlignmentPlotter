# AlignmentPlotter

This is a simple script for running a BLAST alignment on local files and outputting an easy to follow dot/line plot of the results. It is similar to [D-GENIES](https://dgenies.toulouse.inra.fr), but D-GENIES only works well for very large sequence sets like whole genomes. AlignmentPlotter can work for relatively short sequences and is mainly used to show the "composition" of a longer sequence in terms of other shorter sequences.

Here are example outputs I used in (link to paper once I publish it):
